Take aim and unleash powerful balls to smash through waves of colorful circles in Circle Hit, a fast-paced arcade game that challenges your precision, timing, and strategy. The controls are simple—swipe to aim and release to shoot—but mastering the game takes skill, as every shot counts and smart angles are key. Your ball ricochets off walls, blasts through targets, and triggers satisfying chain reactions as you progress through 50 handcrafted levels with unique layouts and steadily increasing difficulty. Circles don’t just stand still: moving targets keep you on your toes, while tougher circles require multiple hits to break through their defenses. A time challenge system pushes you to finish levels as quickly as possible to earn up to three stars, and launching multiple balls at once adds even more strategic depth. You can track your progress with detailed statistics for each level, including best times, number of attempts, and stars earned, and pause or resume the game anytime without losing progress. Whether you play for a minute or an hour, Circle Hit delivers addictive, physics-based gameplay that keeps you coming back for more.
